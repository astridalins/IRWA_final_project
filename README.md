## FINAL PROJECT (PART 1)
This project is part of the **Information Retrieval and Web Analytics (IRWA)** coursework.
It focuses on processing and analyzing an e-commerce fashion products dataset to prepare it for search and retrieval tasks.
The work covers both **text preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

See **Deployment** for notes on how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites

You need to have installed:

Python 3.8+  
Jupyter Notebook  
pip (package manager)

Also, install the following libraries:

pip install pandas numpy nltk matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/IRWA_Project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd IRWA_Project

3. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook FINAL_PROJECT_IRWA.ipynb

4. Run the cells in order to:
   - Preprocess and clean the dataset.  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
   - Visualize the results with charts and word clouds.

### End-to-End Tests

Verify that the text processing pipeline runs correctly:

1. Load dataset  
2. Clean text (stopwords, tokenization, stemming)  
3. Generate statistics and visualizations

## Deployment

You can export results and visualizations to HTML or PDF directly from Jupyter Notebook, or integrate the preprocessing pipeline into a future search API.

## Built With

Python - Main programming language  
pandas, numpy - Data handling  
nltk - Natural language processing  
matplotlib, seaborn - Visualization  
wordcloud - Word clouds generation
